/**
* # Submodule: generate-subnets
* This module's purpose is to generate the opinionated subnetting and secondary VPC configurations as part of the GCP LZ project.
* 
* While it is parameterized for flexibility, it may not be suitable for general purpose subnet mapping creation without a little more polish.
* Specifically, it is designed to be used with https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-network.  
*
* NOTE:  If you wish to use https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/cloud-foundation-fabric instead, it will require modification as that module requires parameters of different structures.
